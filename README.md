# python_password_generator
 This is a simple small program addressed to people whome can't figure out a secure passwords for there own public accounts.
 
Just run the program on a command console and pass in a bunch of letters that seems familiar to you, and it will generate a sequence of symbols based on what you've inserted.

of course, the program does not support multiple sequences generation. all I can say is that everything comes at the right moment.
